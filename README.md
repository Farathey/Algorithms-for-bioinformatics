## Algorithms_1
### First project in the course of algorithms for bioinformatics

In the first project I was tasked with creating matrix class and implement methods listed below:
1. Summing all values
2. Summing values in given row/column, creating list of summed values in the list
3. Finding min/max value
4. Calculate average value in matrix
5. Calculating average values in columns/rows
6. Checking if matrix is square
7. Multiplying matrix by numerical value
8. Add two martices
9. Multiply matrix by another matrix
